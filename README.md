# Disease Overseas

Game created with Melody as our final project for our Grade 10 Computer Science class, using Python 2.7 and Pygame.

A deadly virus has spread. 4 out of the 5 continents contain an antidote. Travel on plane (and on foot for the final round) through a continent each round while dodging the viruses in the air to retrieve all 4 antidotes.
